<p>My recent publication on <i>Head-Gear, Antique and Modern</i>, will be delivered to
all our customers. Should there be any who do not receive a copy, they will do me a favor
by making application at the store where they will be supplied. I take great pleasure in
presenting the only work exclusively devoted to this subject ever published, trusting a perusal of
its pages will be at least interesting, if not instructive. I have used every effort to make it a
correct description of styles, beginning with Egypt in the days of the Pharaohs (dating back
nearly six thousand years) and ending with modern Paris, giving some twenty pages of beautifully
executed illustrations, and thirty pages of descriptive essays and quotations from
ancient and modern writers.</p>

<p>We solicit continuance of your patronage this coming season,
and feel confident that with a rich and varied assortment of millinery goods and perfect
artists we shall be able to sustain our motto “<i>CORRECT STYLES</i>.”</p>

<p>The object of this work is to give an idea of the fashions
in head-gear of ancient and modern times, which
to most people are very interesting. To obtain anything
like a correct description thereof, it is necessary to consult
not only history, but also laws, poems, and biographies.
For this, few have opportunity or inclination; and this
work is an earnest endeavor to supply in a condensed form
what I have found to be a <i>desideratum</i>; and I believe it
contains a correct description of styles not to be found in
any other work, and no statement is made without the
most patient study and research.</p>

<p>As civilization and mental improvement advance in any
country, a laudable curiosity is awakened to inquire into,
and become acquainted with, the appearances, manners,
and opinions of other nations and times. To gratify this
curiosity, and to assist in this effort to be informed respecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the individual manners and customs, the external
appearance, and the general fashions of different peoples
and periods, this work is issued, presenting to the eye a
series of judiciously selected and well executed representations
of the original and ancient head-dress, and quotations
and facts gleaned from ancient history to verify
their correctness.</p>

<p>Trusting this work will interest, if not benefit, its readers,</p>

<p>Perhaps the most ancient head-dress that we find mentioned
in history is the tiara. Strabo informs us that it
was in the form of a tower.</p>

<p>It is often seen carved upon ancient medals, and Servius
calls it a Phrygian cap. The kings and heroes of Homer
and Virgil wore this head-dress:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>Woman is defined by an ancient writer to be an “animal
that delights in finery”; and it is to be feared the
annals of dress in every land, the most savage as well as
the most civilized, will but prove the truth of the assertion.</p>

<p>A caul is a very ancient head-dress; it is mentioned in
the Bible, and by many old writers; it was usually made
of net-work, of gold or silk, and enclosed all the hair.
Some were set with jewels, and were very heavy and of
great value. In the time of Virgil cauls were much
worn:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Her head with ringlets of her hair is crowned,</div>

<p class="caption">Females. Musicians from Theban Tombs. In the reign of
Menes, 3893 years B.C.</p>
</div>

<p>It appears that females were the chief musicians, and
these were probably ladies of rank, for they are robed in
that delicate texture which was then called “Woven Air.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>The figures on the opposite page give an illustration of
Chinese women in full dress. Fig. 3 represents a married
lady with her hair tied on top of the head. A quantity of
false hair was used to make a tuft as large as possible,
filled with gold or silver pins, the ends of which were
highly ornamented with jewels. Artificial flowers were
often used to ornament the head. But the favorite coiffure—the
object of a Chinese lady’s greatest admiration—was
an artificial bird, formed of gold or silver, intended
to represent Fong-Whang, a fabulous bird of which the
ancients relate many marvellous tales. It was worn in
such a manner that the wings stretched over the front of
the head; the spreading tail made a kind of plume on the
top, and the body was placed over the forehead, while the
neck and beak hung down; and the former, being fastened
to the body with an invisible hinge, vibrated with the least
motion.</p>

<p>The recorded history of China begins 2697 years

and costumes of a later date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>The researches of scholars and critics which have been
so generously and successfully lavished, for the last two
centuries, upon the ruins of Egypt, are perfectly marvellous,
and only increase our desire to be more acquainted
with its customs, of which we can find but little in the way
of head-dress to ornament these pages. Figure 7, on the
opposite page, represents King Rameses First and his
queen, who reigned through the most illustrious period
of Egyptian history, in the nineteenth dynasty, about
1411 B.C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>In the early history of Rome, 550 years B.C., in the
reign of Servius Tullius, there seems to have been nothing
whatever of head-dress.</p>

<p>Thus we read in the “Æneid”:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loose was her hair and wanton’d in the wind.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ribbons or fillets were a very general head-dress.</p>

<p>Thus Virgil says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In perfect view their hair with fillets tied.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her beauteous breast she beat and rent her flowing hair.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Strabo says, that in Athens it consisted of a wreath of
myrtle leaves and roses around the head, forming a corobulus.</p>

<p>The hair over the forehead of Apollo Belvidere is an
example of a corobulus. And the hair was twined or
spun around a spindle, in the shape of a cone, and one or
more of these projected from the crown of the head, with
a golden grasshopper for ornament, as seen in Fig. 10.</p>

<p>Four hundred and eighty years B.C., hats were not worn
as a rule, and dress was in simple style. It was considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
improper for women to be seen on the street, and their
appearance there occurred only on exceptional occasions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">8 9 10 11 12</p>
<p class="caption">Athens.</p>
</div>

<p>On journeys, women wore a light, broad-brimmed petasos,
which Figs. 8 and 11 represent, as a protection from
the sun. At a late period the head-dress of Athenian
ladies, at home and for the street, consisted, in addition to
the customary veil, chiefly of different contrivances for
holding together their plentiful hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>At an early period, Greek women wore longer or shorter
veils, which covered the face up to the eyes, and, falling
over the neck and back in heavy folds, covered the whole
upper part of the body.</p>

<p>We often find instances of the exquisite taste of these
head-dresses in statuary and gems of ancient origin; at
the same time it must be confessed that most modern
fashions, even the ugly ones, have their models, if not in
Greek, at least in Roman antiquity.</p>

<p>A ribbon used to be worn around the head, tied in front
with an elaborate knot. The net—after it the ’kerchief—was
developed from the simple ribbon, in the same manner
as straps on the feet gradually became boots.</p>

<p>The head-dress of the women, as well as their costumes,
were different at different periods, as figures on preceding
page illustrate.</p>

<p>Homer frequently mentions the veil as a part of the
attire of the Grecian and Trojan ladies.</p>

<p>Of Helen, he says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er her fair face a snowy veil she threw,</div>

<p>The ancient head-dress of the Irish appears to be but
little known till the twelfth century, when it is said to
have been much the same as that worn by the Southern
Britons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p class="caption">England, A.D. 450.</p>
</div>

<p>In ancient Britain, from the earliest time to the arrival
of the Saxons, A.D. 450, we can find no mention made of
ladies’ head-dress, and but little is mentioned until about
1066, and even at this date not any style existed, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Anglo-Saxon females of all ranks wore a veil, or long
piece of linen or silk wrapped around the head and neck.
This part of their dress was exceedingly unbecoming,
perhaps partly owing to the want of skill in the artists,
and this head-dress was seldom worn except when they
went from home (see figures on preceding page), as the
hair itself was cherished and ornamented with as much
attention as in modern times.</p>

<p>In an Anglo-Saxon poem the heroine is called, “The

<p>About this time the fashions began to travel northward
from Italy, through Paris to London, and caps, hats, and
bonnets of various and fantastic shapes were introduced.</p>

<p>In England, artificial flowers were unknown till the
reign of Edward III., A.D. 1041.</p>

<p>Artificial flowers, those beautiful imitations of the
“stars of the earth,” are brought to such perfection
that they almost rival the blossoms they are intended
to imitate.</p>

<p>In France, during the reign of Charles VIII., in 1483,
it is recorded that head-dresses were lowered considerably;
but in the portrait of Mary of Burgundy, we find that she
still wore the favorite towering cap that had been fashionable
for two hundred years before her time, with the veil
hanging to the ground and a square piece lying upon the
neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>It is a hard thing to say, but the women might have
carried the Gothic building, this steeple head-dress, much
higher had it not been for a famous monk, Thomas
Conects by name, who attacked it with great zeal and
resolution.</p>

<p>This holy man travelled around to preach down this
monstrous style, and succeeded so well, that, as the magicians
sacrificed their books to the flames upon the preaching
of an Apostle, so many of the women threw down their
head-dresses in the middle of his sermon, and made a bonfire
of them within sight of the pulpit. He was so renowned,
as well for the sanctity of his life as his manner of
preaching, that he would often have twenty thousand
people at a time to listen to him. The men placed themselves
on one side of the pulpit and the women on the
other, and the latter appeared (to use the similitude of an
ingenious writer) like a forest of cedars with their heads
reaching to the clouds, but, like snails in a fright, drew
their horns in, to shoot them out again as soon as the
danger was gone.</p>

<p>Whenever they wore them in public, they were pelted
down by the rabble with stones; but, nevertheless, they
mounted them again after a short time. The customs of
the Norman peasants in many respects differ from those
of Britain. The head-dress called Burgonin is the most
remarkable and conspicuous part of their attire.</p>

<p>As we advance in these pages one would suppose we
ought to be exhibiting styles more quiet; but, on the
contrary, when we look at Figures 38 and 39, which have
been selected from miniatures in MSS., it would seem
that improvement was made in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>The caps shown on the opposite page, in Figs. 40, 41,
and 42, were worn in the reign of William and Mary in
1688, and were quite becoming.</p>

<p>In 1750 there was a change for the worse, and as we
advance to Figs. 43, 44, and 45, we find them ridiculous.</p>

to their beauty.</p>

1830, indicate a reaction against the Voltairean philosophy
and French Revolution, and a return to chivalry and devotion.</p>

<p>At this period they were heart-shape in front, in remembrance
of Mary Stuart, imitating an open carriage,

<p>In 1850 a modification is observable, as shown in
Fig. 50.</p>

<p>As we arrive at the fashions of 1870 (Fig. 51), we begin
to feel more at home. Of course each generation thinks

modistes, no doubt, will look back upon our present styles
as we do on the fashions of centuries past.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ladies’ Dress Caps.</span></h3>

<p>As yet no mention has been made of caps, but a great
many of the illustrations of simple head-covering resemble
caps more than hats or bonnets, although not so designated.
Figs. 52, 53, and 54 are dress caps worn by the
French in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Fig.
55 shows a new style of dress cap called the “Thyra,”
composed of Bretonne lace, ribbon, and flowers; the
crown being of dotted lace.</p>

<p>Fig. 56 is a muslin breakfast cap called the “Langtry,”
made of Valenciennes lace, falling over the front, finished
with an Alsatian bow, and the crown of Swiss muslin.</p>

<p>Fig. 57 is a new and novel idea called the “Turban,”
composed entirely of a large silk handkerchief. This is
much worn for a dinner or evening toilet. The last three
styles are taken from the originals at</p>

<p>On the opposite page (Fig. 58) is an illustration of
the very latest Paris bonnet by Madame Magnièr.</p>

<p>The foundation is heavy corded silk of cream-color,
with an immense wreath of Mignonette covering the front
of the crown and drooping gracefully to the left, with face-trimming
of a simple knot of Bretonne lace.</p>

<p>Fig. 59, designed and executed at Wadleigh’s, is a white
French chip. The face of the bonnet has alternate pipings
of light-blue and cardinal satin, with a shirring of the latter.
The outside is composed of a knot and twist of Sultan
silk mingled with Bretonne lace, a fine wreath of forget-me-nots,
and drooping cardinal buds, with Bretonne
lace ties. Figs. 60 and 61 are also copies of the latest
spring designs.</p>

<p>Fashion is the only tyrant against whom modern civilization
has not carried on a crusade with success, and its
power is still as unlimited and despotic as ever. There is
no part of the body which has been more exposed to the
vicissitudes of fashion than the head, both as regards its
natural covering of hair and the artificial covering of hats
and bonnets.</p>

<p>For a long period the world has acknowledged the
French to be leaders of fashion. We look to Madame
Virot, and other leading modistes of Paris, from season
to season, for what might be termed first ideas, but still in
all we are obliged to soften down and modify them to suit
the more simple taste of American ladies.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ancient Mourning Costumes</span>,</h3>

<p class="noindent">the outward signs of woe and sorrow, have always been
demonstrated by some peculiarity in color in all nations.</p>

<p>The Roman women under the Republic wore black;
under the Emperors white was adopted.</p>

<p>Grecian women covered their faces and wear black.</p>

<p>The Chinese, Siamese, and Japanese wear white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>Turks wear blue or violet.</p>

<p>Ethiopians wear gray.</p>

<p>Peruvians wear mouse-color.</p>

<p>Spaniards formerly wore white serge.</p>

<p>Italian women formerly wore white, the men brown.</p>

<p>Syria and Armenia wear blue.</p>

<p>In France, mourning apparel was formerly white.</p>

<p>The following explanation has been given of the cause
of the adoption of different colors for the symbol of
mourning:—</p>

<p>White is the emblem of purity; celestial blue indicates
the space where the soul ranges after death; yellow (or
dead leaf) exhibits death as the end of hope, and man falling
like the leaf in autumn; gray is the color of the earth,
our common mother; black—the color of mourning now
general throughout Europe—indicates eternal night.
“Black,” says Rabelais, “is the sign of mourning, because
it is the color of darkness, which is melancholy, and the
opposite to white, which is the color of light, of joy, and
of happiness.”</p>

<p>The first thing that a woman should consider in preparing
for the great work, her toilette, is the shape of her
head, which she must also compare with her stature. The
art of dressing the head and the art of fashion are connected
without being identical, and in spite of their close union
we can readily distinguish them. Whatever may be the
material, it is important not to forget that variety is the
enemy of severity.</p>

<p>A single color freely used by itself would be more
severe than several colors. Let there be no mistake:
there are many things in the bonnet which do not depend
upon fashion, which are released from its absolute yet
limited control. We must be clearly understood: the
suitableness of a bonnet may vary.</p>

<p>A bonnet which would appear smart in the city may
be elegant and suitable for the country or for the sea-side,
provided the rest of the dress is in keeping. At
such times a little liberty is allowable. Flowers have a
great deal of character, also feathers, ribbons, lace, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
gauze. It is only a slight thread that connects these with
our feelings, but that slight thread is never broken.</p>

<p>In closing with these few suggestions, it would be well
to remark that it is very important when ladies are making
their selections for head-dress, and are not fully decided
in their wants, it is generally well to yield to the judgment
of those who make it a study, providing they are sure
that they are in the hands of such of experience. An
observing person, in attending our fashionable churches,
operas, or even promenading the streets, cannot fail to
notice how comparatively small the number of ladies who
wear a suitable and becoming style head-dress. It has
often been remarked by some of our leading modistes,
that only one lady in twenty has the head becomingly
dressed, showing that in selecting they have not studied
their complexion, stature, and general style, when the
expense would really have been no greater had they
done so.</p>

<p>One of God’s eternal laws is that nothing stands still.
A nation is always changing for better or worse. A people
either marches towards perfection or retrogrades.
Every bud that blossoms seemingly throws out some
new delicate fragrance; every day, every hour, something
new and startling falls upon the ear. Every fresh thought
that rushes into the mind of the inventor marches with
electric speed to further development. Those who have
carefully studied the subject of this work well know what
grand and noble strides fashion has taken towards perfection,
without reaching it, however, as the result of one
day’s delay in going to press necessitates a still later style.
